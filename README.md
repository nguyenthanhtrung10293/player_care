This is a small project to gather player feedback on Supercell game

## Project Overview

This project is a small study case to demonstrate how to:
- Collect Reddit comments from Supercell-related subreddits using the Reddit API (PRAW).
- Clean and preprocess the comments.
- Use OpenAI (or Databricks LLM) to categorize each comment into categories such as Bug, Feature Request, Positive, Negative, or Other.
- Summarize and visualize the categorized feedback for analysis.

The workflow includes data collection, AI-powered categorization, and exporting results for further visualization and dashboarding.

After the analysing, we can see that 3 big games had similar amount of comments on Reddit mean they are all popular. Except the category Other, we can see that Positive and Negative feedback are now quite equal. Need more clarification to break down the Other category
